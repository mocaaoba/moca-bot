# moca-bot

Moca uses some preprocessing and optical character recognition in order to read raid codes from images and output them for an easy to copy format. This is particularly useful for Discord servers that house multiple crews and want to share their raids across different crews. Currently used by: AzureSol & AzureSeal.

Additional features include searching the GBF wiki and nhentai. I maintain that the latter was due to that feature being the most requested one.

Powered by Heroku free hosting (shit service I tell you what. 99% of delay is just from the server being bad. I guess I got what I paid for).
